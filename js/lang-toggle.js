Upon arriving in Denver, Delia dreamed of creating a place where Central Americans could feel at home, and Jorge was always by her side to make it happen. Their first store on Colorado Boulevard was as small as a closet, but it offered the flavors and traditions that reminded people of their homeland. With effort and heart, they grew to open the larger store on East Colfax, where today they offer a wide variety of products that celebrate Central American culture. For Delia and Jorge, the store is much more than a business: it is a pillar of the community, a way to keep traditions alive in Denver families, and a legacy of love, resilience, and pride that continues to inspire their children, grandchildren, and neighbors.",

Su primera tienda en Colorado Boulevard era tan pequeña como un clóset, pero ofrecía los sabores y tradiciones que recordaban a la gente su tierra natal. Con esfuerzo y corazón, crecieron hasta abrir la tienda más grande en East Colfax, donde hoy ofrecen una amplia variedad de productos que celebran la cultura centroamericana. Para Delia y Jorge, la tienda es mucho más que un negocio: es un pilar de la comunidad, una manera de mantener vivas las tradiciones en las familias de Denver, y un legado de amor, resiliencia y orgullo que sigue inspirando a sus hijos, nietos y vecinos.",
